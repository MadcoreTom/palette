I made [this on codepen](https://codepen.io/madcoretom/pen/QWddRpB) a while ago, and wanted to port it to typescript and React. I'll blog about it later on [madcoretom.com](https://www.madcoretom.com)

Topics of interest include
* Generator functions
* Realtime rendering & React combined
* Colour theory?
